/*
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

/*

	Find Palindromes
	

	Notes:
		need to find: 
			how to recognise palindromic numbers
			how to find palindromic numbers
	
		perhaps:
			make a palindromic number
					-> there are either 5 or 6 digits!

			find the factors of it
				-> make sure those factors are indeed 3-digit numbers, ie 99 < X < 1000
				-> only two factors


		A palindromic number is constructed such that:
			Digit A
			Digit B
			Digit C
			...

			Number: A B C ... C B A


		Currently have every 6 digit palindrome couting down from 999999 to 100001

		now need to check if one of these palindromes divided by some three digit number
		is also a three digit number.
